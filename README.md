# Monte Carlo methods using Python

The code is from an online tutorial on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGu5hUarTik&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdhOnp-FnVStDsALpYk2hk0&index=14) and all code belongs to 
Harrison Kinsley (thanks a lot Harrison).

I did some changes to make everything compatible to python3. The file names correspond to the youtube videos, and the code in each file builds on the previous one, as the tutorial videos proceed.
